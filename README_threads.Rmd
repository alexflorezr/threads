# Threads -- Menswear analytical tools

## Fashion week
Fashion week shows can be used as data source to forecast trends in the upcoming seasons. For every designer is possible to obtain the show looks from:

* Vogue.com
* Bussiness of Fashion
* TAGWALK

I will start with TAGWALK because it can provide tags that define traits in the outfits.
